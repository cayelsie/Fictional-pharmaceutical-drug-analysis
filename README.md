The pymaceuticals_main.ipynb file in the Pymaceuticals folder contains a Jupyter notebook with a detailed data analysis for a study conducted at Pymaceuticals Inc (a fictional pharmaceutical company). The data comes from a fictional study that was screening potential drugs for the treatment of skin cancer. The aim of the study was to compare the performance of Capomulin, the current drug of interest, to other potential drugs. Plots related to the analysis were created using Pandas plot and Matplotlib. 

The Jupyter notebook includes the following tasks/analyses: checking data for duplicate entries and removal of that data, a general statistical summary on tumor volume measurement for subjects on each drug regimen (mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM), bar plots of the number of measurements taken for each drug regimen (identical plots plotted using both Pandas and Matplotlib), pie plots of the gender distribution among subjects in the study (identical plots plotted using both pandas and matplotlib), an IQR analysis to detect potential outliers in final tumor volumes of subjects treated with Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin with a box and whisker plot to visualize these calculations, a line plot of one subject treated with Capomulin that compares tumor volume vs the time point of treatment, and a scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for subjects treated with Capomulin with a linear regression model.
